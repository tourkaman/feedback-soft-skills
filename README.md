# feedback-soft-skills
Your soft skills: collecting feedback, tracking progress.

Inspired by [this list](https://neilonsoftware.com/soft-skills) from [Neil Green](https://neilonsoftware.com).

Todo: Create a CSV template or spreadsheet generator for printing or sending to friends and colleagues in order to quickly gather feedback on where you stand on your soft skills, as well as later also being able to visually track your progress with time.
